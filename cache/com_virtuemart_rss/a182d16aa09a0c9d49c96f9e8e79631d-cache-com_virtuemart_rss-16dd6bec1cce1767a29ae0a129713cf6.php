<p>The company Qualys.com found a new issue, a possible XSS. It misuses the array keys in the URL. Most servers prevent such an URL by default, but nevertheless we've added another protection. We also found and fixed some smaller bugs and glitches in advanced functions and last but not least we added missing backward compatibility for some cases. This release follows 3 release candidates with more than 2000 downloads altogether.</p>
<h3>New Goal</h3>
<p>Sticking to the Joomla API has emerged as an unlucky decision for us. The future plan is to write more for our own framework VMF, which will give us the freedom to also use other systems than Joomla. The idea is to write a small framework, so that extensions written for VirtueMart should also work on different platforms than Joomla. In other words, instead of developing a standalone VirtueMart, we will try to write an easily bridgeable VirtueMart. We already saw a VirtueMart running on Drupal, so it can't be too hard. But first we want to look into Wordpress. Of course we will need test users and suggestions from developers who are familiar with Wordpress and VirtueMart. So please join our forum if you have some experience with these. We also think about using the Joomla platform by the team of Johan Janssens&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-platform">https://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-platform</a> for our next full installer.</p>
<h3>New Docs</h3>
<p>Due to our membership system <a href="http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail">http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail</a> we did find some time to update our manual. We added a lot of pages, which explain general VirtueMart concepts at <a href="http://docs.virtuemart.net/manual/general-concepts.html">http://docs.virtuemart.net/manual/general-concepts.html</a> - It's worthwhile to read them. Even VirtueMart veterans already found some new tricks in it!</p>

<p>The last stable version vm3.0.8 was 5 months ago. Development has continued during this time, we just spent additional time testing and checking to deliver a more stable version.</p>
<p>We added the ajax script to the cart, so that the new cart is almost like an OPC, you will still add/edit addresses in a separate page. It is backward compatible as long any 3rd party developer/templater uses our javascript handler <a href="http://docs.virtuemart.net/tutorials/development/196-the-vm-javascript-handler.html">http://docs.virtuemart.net/tutorials/development/196-the-vm-javascript-handler.html</a></p>
<p>The ACL (Access Control List) has been extensively extended and modified. It now supports seperate settings for frontend and backend management.</p>
